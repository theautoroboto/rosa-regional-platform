# Provisioning a Development Environment

Ephemeral environments are short-lived, isolated stacks for developing and testing the ROSA Regional Platform. All commands run inside a container on your local machine (podman or docker) and interact with shared development AWS credentials (central, regional, management accounts).

Each environment gets a unique ID that prefixes all provisioned resources, keeping environments isolated from each other. The ephemeral provider creates a managed clone of your remote branch and uses it to drive provisioning and ArgoCD syncs. To push subsequent changes into a running environment, use [Resync](#resync).

## Provision

> ⚠️ _Ensure your changes are pushed to the remote branch before provisioning — the environment is built from the remote ref, not your local working tree._

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for remote and branch
make ephemeral-provision

# Explicit — skip the picker
make ephemeral-provision REPO=owner/repo BRANCH=my-feature
```

On success the command prints the environment ID as well as guidance to interact with the environment.

The region is derived from the environment config (see [Customizing Your Environment](#customizing-your-environment)). By default it provisions in `us-east-1`.

To view and interact with provisioned environments at a later point in time, see [List Environments](#list-environments).

## Customizing Your Environment

By default, ephemeral environments use the preset in `config/ephemeral/` (bastion enabled, single MC in `us-east-1`). You can replace this config entirely for your local development by creating a `.ephemeral-env/` directory in the repo root.

### Structure

The `.ephemeral-env/` directory must mirror the `config/<env>/` structure:

```
.ephemeral-env/
├── defaults.yaml        # Environment-level defaults (optional)
└── us-east-1.yaml       # Region config (exactly one region file required)
```

This directory is gitignored — it only affects your local machine.

### Constraints

- Exactly **one region file** (besides `defaults.yaml`) must exist — the ephemeral provisioner deploys to a single region.
- The region file must define **`provision_mcs`** with at most **one management cluster** (only one MC account is available in the shared dev setup).
- AWS account IDs are injected automatically from credentials — do not set `aws.account_id` or `aws.management_cluster_account_id`.

### Examples

Use default topology but enable bastion and change instance types:

```yaml
# .ephemeral-env/defaults.yaml
regional_cluster:
  enable_bastion: true
  node_instance_types: ["m5.xlarge"]

management_cluster_defaults:
  enable_bastion: true
  node_instance_types: ["m5.xlarge"]
```

```yaml
# .ephemeral-env/us-east-1.yaml
provision_mcs:
  mc01: {}
```

Provision in a different region:

```yaml
# .ephemeral-env/us-east-2.yaml
provision_mcs:
  mc01: {}
```

### Applying Changes

Overrides are applied during `provision` and `resync`. To update a running environment after editing `.ephemeral-env/`:

```bash
make ephemeral-resync ID=<id>
```

## List Environments

Lists environments you have provisioned from your local machine. State is cached in the `.ephemeral-envs` file in the repo root — you can clear it at any time by deleting the file.

To interact with a previously provisioned environment, list your environments and pass the ID to the relevant command (e.g. `make ephemeral-shell ID=<id>`).

```bash
make ephemeral-list
```

Example:

```
Ephemeral environments:

ID           REPO                                          BRANCH                    REGION       STATE                  CREATED              API_URL
------------ --------------------------------------------- ------------------------- ------------ ---------------------- -------------------- -------
6bd2d3d7     typeid/rosa-regional-platform                 ROSAENG-143               us-east-1    ready                  2026-03-19T10:14:23Z https://thfvcunmr3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod

To clear list: rm .ephemeral-envs
```

## Shell Access

Opens an interactive shell pre-configured with regional AWS credentials to interact directly with the API Gateway.

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for environment selection
make ephemeral-shell

# Explicit
make ephemeral-shell ID=6bd2d3d7
```

Example:

```
Fetching credentials from Vault (OIDC login)...
Credentials loaded (in-memory only).

ROSA Regional Platform shell

API Gateway: https://thfvcunmr3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod
Region:      us-east-1

Example commands:
  awscurl --service execute-api https://thfvcunmr3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v0/live

[root@df2f729c21c2 /]# awscurl --service execute-api https://thfvcunmr3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/v0/live
{"status":"ok"}
```

## Bastion Access

Connect to a bastion ECS task to access the Kubernetes API of the ephemeral environment's Regional Cluster (RC) or Management Cluster (MC). The bastion runs inside the cluster's VPC and has `kubectl` pre-configured with cluster-admin access.

> ⚠️ _Bastion must be enabled in your environment config (`enable_bastion: true` in `defaults.yaml`). The default ephemeral preset already has it enabled._

```bash
# Regional Cluster bastion
make ephemeral-bastion-rc

# Management Cluster bastion
make ephemeral-bastion-mc

# Explicit environment selection
make ephemeral-bastion-rc ID=6bd2d3d7
```

This fetches credentials from Vault, starts a bastion ECS task if none is running, waits for the execute command agent, and drops you into an interactive shell on the bastion. From there you can run `kubectl` commands against the cluster:

```
==> Bastion task ready
    ECS cluster: ci-f16cec-regional-bastion
    Task ID:     683c1f0af6ae4e1bba3552f2c8215bd3

==> Connecting to bastion...

bash-5.2# kubectl get nodes
NAME                          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-1-42.ec2.internal    Ready    <none>   2h    v1.31.4-eks-aeac579
```

The bastion task stays running until explicitly stopped or until the environment is torn down (teardown automatically cleans up running bastion tasks).

## Run E2E Tests

Run the end-to-end test suite against one of your development environments:

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for environment selection
make ephemeral-e2e

# Explicit
make ephemeral-e2e ID=6bd2d3d7
```

## Resync

The ephemeral environment runs from an ephemeral-provider managed clone of your branch. If you push additional changes to your remote branch after provisioning (e.g. updating a Helm chart or Terraform module), the environment won't pick them up automatically — you need to resync so the cloned branch is updated and ArgoCD syncs the changes.

Resync also re-applies the environment config, so changes to `.ephemeral-env/` are picked up alongside code changes.

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for environment selection
make ephemeral-resync

# Explicit
make ephemeral-resync ID=6bd2d3d7
```

## Tear Down

Destroy an environment and all its resources:

```bash
# Interactive — fzf picker for environment selection
make ephemeral-teardown

# Explicit
make ephemeral-teardown ID=6bd2d3d7
```
